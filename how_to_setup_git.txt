START WORKING ON GIT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GIT is a distributed versioning system. Which means, there is central repository (github) and a local repository created automatically on your machine.
Your changes need to be checked-in into local repository. And they are ready to be published, those can be sent to central repository.
Details are given below...

1. You can check the repository status (if file(s) is added/modified/deleted) as -
	git status
2. If you add new file, execute
	git add <fully_qualified_file_name>
	git commit <fully_qualified_file_name> -m "<some_logical_message_to_explain_the_changes>"
3. If you modify existing file, execute
	git commit <fully_qualified_file_name> -m "<some_logical_message_to_explain_the_changes>"
4. Once all changes are done and need to be published -
	git push origin master

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMONLY USED COMMANDS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Check status - git status
2. Get the code from local repository for the first time - git clone https://github.com/SuhelShaikh/farmer_helpline.git
   Optionally, to get it from branch - git clone https://github.com/SuhelShaikh/farmer_helpline.git -b <branch_name>
3. Marked newly created file for checkin - git add <fully_qualified_file_name>
4. Marked deleted file for checkin - git rm <fully_qualified_file_name>
5. Checkin your changes to local repository - git commit <fully_qualified_file_name> -m "<some_logical_message>"
6. Publish your changes to central repository (github) - git push origin master
7. Get the updates - git pull
